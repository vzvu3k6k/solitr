This is the source code for [solitr.com](http://www.solitr.com/).

## Running

```bash
bundle install
rails server
```

## Testing

Solitr uses [Konacha](https://github.com/jfirebaugh/konacha) for testing. To
run the test suite, type `bundle exec rake konacha:run`. For development, it's
easier to run `bundle exec rake konacha:serve` and run the tests in the browser
(http://localhost:3500). The test files are located in the `spec/javascripts`
directory.

There are not many tests yet, but we are adding them as we go. Probably the
easiest (and also most important) part to test is the data models, because they
don't interact with the DOM.

## Architecture

See [this post](http://www.solitr.com/blog/2012/02/mvc-design/) for a short
introduction to the code design.

## To-Do

* Make the mouse cursor a hand (`pointer` in CSS parlance) when hovering
  draggable cards or clickable elements.
